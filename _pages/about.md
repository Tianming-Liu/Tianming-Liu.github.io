I specialize in `mobile sensing` and `space computing`, exploring how emerging sensing technologies can advance our understanding of human-environment interactions. My research integrates `multimodal data acquisition`, `geospatial analytics`, and `computational modeling` to bridge machine perception with spatial cognition, developing methodologies that inform evidence-based environmental design.

I hold an MSc in Connected Environments from `University College London (CASA)` (2024), a Master's in Landscape Architecture from `Beijing Forestry University` (2023), and a Bachelor of Engineering from `China Agricultural University` (2020). My interdisciplinary training enables me to address complex questions at the intersection of spatial data science and human-centered design.

My research focuses on understanding how built environments influence human perception, cognition, and behavior through integrated mobile sensing,particularly in `data-sparse regions`. This work spans three interconnected directions: developing multimodal sensing systems that combine computer vision, environmental sensors, and physiological monitoring to capture both objective spatial conditions and subjective human experiences; applying `AI-driven spatial analytics` to model relationships between environmental features and human responses; and translating these insights into actionable design intelligence.
