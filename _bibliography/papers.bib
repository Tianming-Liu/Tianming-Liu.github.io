  abstract={Terraces are a unique type of agro-ecosystem that are vital for regional food security, biodiversity, and the provision of cultural ecosystem services (CES) to society. This study introduces a novel approach to map the supply–demand balance of terrace CES (TCES) in China by integrating geo-data and social media images. Firstly, a TCES supply assessment framework is developed, comprising scenic attractiveness and heritage attractiveness, to assess TCES supply. Secondly, based on 55,616 geotagged Weibo images, the EfficientNet model classifies images into seven categories, with a questionnaire linking these to four CES types: aesthetic services, heritage & cultural services, recreation & tourism services, and spiritual & emotional services. Population data is also used to assess TCES demand. Finally, the supply–demand ratio and bivariate Moran’s I examine the balance and spatial autocorrelation of TCES. The results show: 1) High supply areas are mainly in southern China, while demand is more scattered in several hotspots; 2) There is a significant positive spatial autocorrelation between supply and demand, where higher supply promotes greater demand. High CES supply and demand cluster in Zhejiang-Fujian Hills and Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, with imbalances occurring in metropolitan areas or mountainous areas along provincial boundaries. These findings and methodologies provide valuable insights for the planning and management of terraces in China, as well as for future CES-related studies.},

  abstract={This study proposes a novel spatial analysis and design approach for urban park planning based on the self-organizing mechanisms of complex systems. By analyzing urban Point of Interest (POI) data and integrating urban feature information into a slime mold multi-agent model, we explore the systemic spatial functional relationships between urban parks and their surrounding urban context. The method employs POI data mapping and multi-agent spatial simulations to generate spatial structures that reflect functional penetration from the city into the site, guiding the formation of the park’s spatial morphology. The results demonstrate that this approach is highly feasible for landscape design of small and medium-sized sites. The simulation of slime mold growth behavior effectively captures the infiltration of site-related urban information into spatial configurations, producing functional zoning characterized by self-organized path textures. Overall, the multi-agent model, supported by spatial algorithms, enables the incorporation and mapping of site and contextual spatial information through collective agent behavior, offering a new paradigm of thinking for landscape and urban design.},
